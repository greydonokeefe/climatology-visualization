# Climatology Visualization

This project is a Python-based climatology visualization tool. It uses historical and recent weather data to generate graphs that showcase temperature trends over time.

## Features

- **Yearly Climatological Data**:
  - Visualizes daily temperatures in New York - JFK Station for the most recent 10 years.
  - Displays trends using line plots.

- **Historical Average Comparison**:
  - Compares historical daily average temperatures to a specific year (e.g., 2021) using bar plots.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Graphing and visualization.

## Files in the Repository

- `HW13_Starter_Code.py`: The Python script for processing and visualizing the weather data.
- `jfk_weather.csv`: Weather data for JFK International Airport.
- `weather.csv`: Sample weather dataset.
- `README.md`: This file!
